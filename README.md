SeeSawphys Pong - A game where two players must cooperate to control the motion of a ping pong ball via the tilt of a seesaw, which corresponds to the motion of the pong paddle in game. The players earn a point every time they successfuly hit the bouncing ball with their paddle, and an additional two points when they score on the computer controlled opponent.
